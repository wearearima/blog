You don't have to look far to see that Kubernetes continues to grow as the leading technology in the cloud-native ecosystem. In a recent survey by the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/05/04/the-state-of-cloud-native-development-a-new-survey-report/){:target="_blank"} it shows that 78% of participants are using Kubernetes in production. With this landscape where there are many projects with different technologies, we must not lose sight of the quality of the Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Open Policy Agent

Today Iâ€™m going to talk about [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/){:target="_blank"}, a policy engine that provides a high-level declarative language to define policy and ensure its compliance with a wide range of integrations in different systems: microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways and more. In the image below we can see some examples of OPA use with different systems.

## What is a policy? What does OPA provide?

A policy is a set of rules that govern the behavior of a software service. This policy can describe speed limits, names of trusted servers, the clusters in which an application must be deployed, permitted network routes, or simply accounts from which a user can withdraw money.

These days, a policy is often a hard-coded feature within the software service which is actually in control. **What Open Policy Agent allows us to do is to decouple the policy from that software service** so that the people responsible for the policy can read, write, analyze, version, distribute and generally manage the policy separately from the service per se.

OPA also provides a unified set of tools to decouple policies from whatever software service and write context-sensitive policies using any desired context.

## How does it work?

As I said, OPA allows decoupling of software policy. When the software needs to make policy decisions, it consults OPA by providing structured data (for example, JSON) as input. OPA will evaluate whether it allows or denies actions with the information provided (data) and will make a decision.

For OPA to make a decision, three factors are necessary:

- **Data:** Information provided in JSON format so that OPA is able to evaluate whether actions are allowed or denied.
- **Query:** Defines the question which OPA has to decide on and starts the decision-making process. It must be provided in JSON format.
- **Policy:** Set of defined rules. OPA interprets the defined rules, and based on the data provided, _data_, and the question to be decided on, _query_, generates an answer, _decision_. Policies are written using Rego.

## Rego

OPA policies are expressed in a high-level declarative language called Rego. Rego (pronounced "ray-go") is specifically designed to express policies on complex hierarchical data structures. For detailed information on Rego, you can refer to [the policy language documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/){:target="_blank"}.

## OPA for Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, the [Admission Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/){:target="_blank"} enforce policies on objects during creation, update and deletion operations. The Admission Controller is critical to the application of policies in Kubernetes.

For example, by implementing OPA as an admission controller, you can:

- Require specific labels on all resources.
- Require container images to come from the corporate image registry.
- Demand that all pods specify requests and resource limits.
- Prevent Ingress objects from being created.
- ...

There are two ways to implement OPA in Kubernetes. 

### OPA with its kube-mgmt sidecar

The Kubernetes API server is configured to check with OPA for admission control decisions when objects are created, updated, or removed (eg, Pods, Services, etc.).

![OPA](/assets/images/2020-12-10-opa/opa.png){: .center }

The API server sends all Kubernetes objects in the webhook request to OPA. OPA evaluates the policies it has uploaded using the admission review as input.

Lastly, the policies given to OPA generate an admission review response that is sent back to the API server.

If any admission controller denies the request, then the request is denied (even if one of the following admission controllers were to allow it).

Policies can be uploaded to OPA dynamically through ConfigMap objects using the additional container kube-mgmt. The kube-mgmt sidecar container can also upload any other Kubernetes objects to OPA as JSON in the data. 

### OPA Gatekeeper

OPA Gatekeeper is a new project that provides a first-class integration between OPA and Kubernetes. For basic information, check out this blog post at [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/08/06/opa-gatekeeper-policy-and-governance-for-kubernetes/){:target="_blank"}.

What it gives us with respect to OPA with kube-mgmt:

- An extensible and parameterized policy library.
- Kubernetes native CRDs for creating policy library instances (also known as "constraints").
- Kubernetes native CRDs to extend the policy library (also known as "constraint templates").
- Audit functionality.

OPA Gatekeeper is still in beta. 

## Conclusion
The Open Policy Agent has a lot of potential because it allows you to decouple software from policies. What I would have liked is for the OPA itself to provide more policy examples for the different systems as I personally find it difficult to create policies with Rego.
